# powerplot-demo

This is a demo app that compiles a couple of typical PowerPlot
use-cases and sample charts. It is an Objective-C app and runs both on
the iPhone and the iPad. The code examples can be found in the
`DemoApp/DemoApp/Charts/` folder. The folder
`DemoApp/DemoApp/Examples/DataModel/` contains a class which provides
demo data used throughout the app.

## Installation

The PowerPlot demo app requires the
[PowerPlot](https://github.com/nua-schroers/powerplot)] framework
which is installed using
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). In order to do the
setup, run

```shell
carthage update --platform iOS
```

Then open the workspace `PowerPlotDemo.xcworkspace/` in Xcode 8 or
higher and you are good to go.
